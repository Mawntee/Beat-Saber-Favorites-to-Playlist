# Beat-Saber-Favorites-to-Playlist
Python tool that digs up the hashes from your "favourites" list, and convert that to a shareable bplist file


This is useful if you've ever cleared your custom songs folder multiple times and want to dig up some of those forgotten long lost maps from back in the day, or if you just want to share your likes folder with some friends. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Usage:**
- Select your "PlayerData.DAT" file
- Set name for playlist file
- Set Title and Author of playlist *(this is what is shown in-game)*
- Convert and save to the "Playlists" folder in your install

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

***NOTE: Python is required for this tool to work!***

*Also, this was generated entirely with ChatGPT, and only briefly tested by myself.* 
*Some things may be scuffed as I literally have zero experience with Python.*
